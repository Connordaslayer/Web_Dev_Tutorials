# Web_Dev_Tutorials
This repository was made by me so that I can keep track, and be able to have a reference of my learning journey.

This repository will cover my learning experiences and projects I will be doing across these topics:
-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-SQL
-Python
-Git
-PHP
-React

All topics listed are all that I will be learning and doing my best to master to enter the web development field.

Of these topics I will be self-taught in, the following tutorials:
-TheOdinProject
-SmolJames Roadmap 
-SoloLearn

This repository will have my projects accessible to everyone to help others and show my thought process on how I learn and develop my skills.

(As of right now I am in highschool so I wont have much time to constantly commit)
